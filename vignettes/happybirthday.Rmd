`happybiRthday` is an R package to essentially do one of two things:

1) Congratulate your friend with the upcoming birthday of their Github package(s)
2) Toast yourself! (to the upcoming birthday of your own Github package(s))


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(happybirthday)
celebrate("Bohdan-Khomtchouk")
```
